***Are you in the right place ?***

If you are looking for an easy-to-read C++ implementation of the main machine learning algorithms, with a simple Python interface for experimenting with the code, you are in the right place.

If you are looking for an optimized, multi-platform, memory-efficient, heavely tested C++ machine learning library with a great community, I would recommend [TensorFlow C++ API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) or [PyTorch C++ API](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/).
